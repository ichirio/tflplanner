# rtfplanner 0.0.0.9000

- Studies: each study is a folder (`study.yml`, `data/`, `spec/`, `programs/`,
  `output/ard/`, `output/tfl/`, `logs/`) created, opened, saved, run and
  tracked from the app (`create_study()`, `open_study()`, `save_study()`,
  `run_study()`, `study_status()`).
- Reports have a type (Table / Listing / Figure); programs run from the
  study folder, Tables save their ARD, generated programs carry a checksum
  and follow the definition until edited by hand.
- First version: a 'shiny' editor for rtfreporter's `table_spec.xlsx` and
  `report_spec.xlsx`, writing one R program per report and
  `autoexec_report.R`.
